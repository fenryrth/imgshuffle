# imgshuffle

This project is a simple screensaver built using the PyGame library. It displays a random sequence of images from a specified folder, fitting them to the screen while preserving their aspect ratios. The screensaver features fade transitions between images and hides the mouse cursor when active.

## Features

- Displays images from a user-specified folder.
- Scales images to fit the screen while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- Randomly shuffles images each time the screensaver starts.
- Implements fade transitions between images.
- Hides the mouse cursor during operation.
- Exits immediately on pressing the `Esc` key.

## Installation

Before running the screensaver, you must install the necessary Python libraries. Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system, and then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
